## Purpose
The purpose of this report is to overview the data for **Fall 2021 survey**. 

You can create lists in R markdown. 
unordered: 
* redo markdown
* do a violin plot

ordered: 
1. load [data](url here)
2. clean data in time series
3. make plot

#High Level Analysis Plan:
1.     Generate straight frequencies and percentages for each question and response
2.     Break down responses by
a.     Respondent college (if ns are big enough) (Primary_Department__r.Name)
 i.     If that is too fine grained, use Parent_Organization__c
b.     By products used (counter.Scheduling/Notes, counter. Service Desk, counter.Events, Counter.Marketing â€“ SF)
 i.     If per product is too fine grained, try Profile.Name
c.     By time using Trellis
 i.     Break into chunks based on user creation date (CreatedDate)
1.     <1 month
2.     1-6 months
3.     6 months to a year
4.     1 year+
3.     Compare the invited list to respondents on the above criteria to see if there is better respondent representation across some groups.

# literate programming approach like a Jupyter Notebook. 
Rmarkdown automatically creates reports. 
You can automatically update your Rmarkdown when data is updated. 
# where did they stop off with the survey
Use the Progress variable

mean time in seconds for incomplete surveys is 16056.78.
mean time in seconds for completed surveys is 28547.17.

For question 3 
```{r}

There are really only 3 user groups. Most are in the over 1 year of use category. So you expect some flexibility. 

re-evaluate some stuff like q4 and q7

Question 7 with period

  # geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "response", y = "number of respondents") 
  # theme(legend.position=element_blank())
  # geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(pct), y = if_else(count > 0.1*max(count), count/2, count+ 0.05*max(count))))


Q7graph <- Q7graph + labs(title = "Which of these tools do you use to get help with Trellis?",

breakdown of profile name and time period

```

Who dropped out of the survey? 
```{r}
fall_survey$Progress_factor <- as.factor(fall_survey$Progress)

table(fall_survey$Progress_factor)
```

31 left after just filling out their name and did not answer any questions. 
1 left after Q3_2
8 left after Q4
1 left after Q9_4
198 was full complete


As for counter events there were 12 for events, 43 for marketing, 185 for scheduling notes, and 65 for service desk.
