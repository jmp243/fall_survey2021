## Overview
The spring survey was sent out to 1267 emails. 239 individuals started the emails and 189 responses were recorded. 

### Key takeaways
* The support from Trellis staff has been positive.
* However, initial training was mainly somewhat satisfactory.
* Members of the Salesforce base found the initial training extremely dissatisfactory.
* Only about half of the respondents were aware of many of the Trellis usage resources. 
* Of those who were aware only about a third used trellis resources such as monthly info sessions, newsletters, release notes, sprint demos and user groups.
